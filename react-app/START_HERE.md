# 🚀 START HERE - React App Quick Start

## The Correct Path

The React app is located at:
```
/Users/jaeilchoi/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/homescorepro/react-app
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Navigate to the React App Directory

**Copy and paste this command:**
```bash
cd "/Users/jaeilchoi/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/homescorepro/react-app"
```

**OR use this shorter version:**
```bash
cd ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/homescorepro/react-app
```

### 2. Verify You're in the Right Place

Run this to confirm:
```bash
pwd
ls package.json
```

You should see:
- `pwd` shows: `/Users/jaeilchoi/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/homescorepro/react-app`
- `ls package.json` shows: `package.json`

### 3. Install Dependencies (if not already done)

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Open in Browser

The terminal will show something like:
```
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```

Open that URL in your browser!

## Quick Copy-Paste Commands

**All in one go:**
```bash
cd "/Users/jaeilchoi/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/homescorepro/react-app" && npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

**If you get "No such file or directory":**
- Make sure you're using the exact path with quotes
- The path has spaces, so quotes are required

**If npm commands don't work:**
- Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Make sure npm is installed: `npm --version`

**If you're still having issues:**
- Check that the react-app folder exists: `ls "/Users/jaeilchoi/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/homescorepro" | grep react`
