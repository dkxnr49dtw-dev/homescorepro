## Integrated Psychological Models

### Model 1: **Flow State Theory** (Csikszentmihalyi)
**Application:** Maintain optimal challenge-skill balance
**Implementation:**
- Progressive difficulty: Start simple, reveal complexity gradually
- Clear goals: "Find your perfect suburb" → "Compare 3 options" → "Make decision"
- Immediate feedback: Scores appear instantly after input
- Focus facilitation: Hide distractions during analysis

**Specific Features:**
- **Challenge Scaling**: Beginner mode (simplified) → Advanced mode (detailed)
- **Goal Clarity**: Progress indicators show "Step 2 of 3"
- **Feedback Loops**: Real-time score updates as inputs change
- **Flow Interruption Prevention**: No pop-ups during active analysis

---

### Model 2: **Variable Reward System** (Skinner/Operant Conditioning)
**Application:** Unpredictable positive outcomes maintain engagement
**Implementation:**
- Score variations create anticipation
- Comparison discoveries provide "aha" moments
- Hidden insights revealed on exploration
- Surprise recommendations based on patterns

**Specific Features:**
- **Score Variations**: Same suburb, different profiles = different insights
- **Discovery Moments**: "You might also like..." suggestions
- **Hidden Gems**: "Top 5% for your budget" reveals
- **Pattern Recognition**: "Properties like this tend to appreciate 8% annually"

---

### Model 3: **Cognitive Load Theory** (Sweller)
**Application:** Manage information processing capacity
**Implementation:**
- Chunk information into digestible pieces
- Progressive disclosure prevents overload
- Visual hierarchy guides attention
- Reduce extraneous load (remove distractions)

**Specific Features:**
- **Information Chunking**: 3-5 metrics per tier, not all at once
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic → Detailed → Expert views
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Size, color, position indicate importance
- **Minimalist Design**: Remove non-essential elements during analysis

---

### Model 4: **Prospect Theory** (Kahneman & Tversky)
**Application:** Loss aversion and framing effects
**Implementation:**
- Frame scores as gains, not losses
- Show what they're "getting" vs. "missing"
- Emphasize potential improvements
- Use reference points (comparisons)

**Specific Features:**
- **Gain Framing**: "You're in the top 20%" not "80% are better"
- **Loss Aversion**: "Save your search" (prevent loss of work)
- **Reference Points**: "Compared to similar suburbs, this scores..."
- **Improvement Potential**: "With renovations, score could reach 85"

---

### Model 5: **Social Proof Theory** (Cialdini)
**Application:** Influence through others' behavior
**Implementation:**
- Show anonymized activity (properties analyzed)
- Display popularity indicators
- Provide comparison benchmarks
- Show success stories (anonymized)

**Specific Features:**
- **Activity Indicators**: "1,247 properties analyzed today"
- **Popularity Signals**: "Most searched suburb this week"
- **Benchmark Comparisons**: "Your score vs. average user"
- **Success Indicators**: "Users who saved this suburb also viewed..."

---

### Model 6: **Self-Determination Theory** (Deci & Ryan)
**Application:** Autonomy, competence, relatedness
**Implementation:**
- Give users control (customize preferences)
- Show competence (progress, achievements)
- Create connection (shared goals, community)

**Specific Features:**
- **Autonomy**: Customize metric weights, save preferences
- **Competence**: Progress tracking, skill development
- **Relatedness**: "Others with similar goals chose..."
- **Mastery**: "You've become an expert at suburb analysis"

---

### Model 7: **Elaboration Likelihood Model** (Petty & Cacioppo)
**Application:** Central vs. peripheral processing routes
**Implementation:**
- Central route: Detailed, logical information (for engaged users)
- Peripheral route: Visual cues, heuristics (for quick decisions)
- Match route to user state and intent

**Specific Features:**
- **Central Route**: Detailed breakdowns, methodology, data sources
- **Peripheral Route**: Visual scores, color coding, quick comparisons
- **Route Detection**: Identify user's processing style (time on page, interactions)
- **Adaptive Presentation**: Adjust depth based on engagement level

---

### Model 8: **Zeigarnik Effect** (Unfinished Tasks)
**Application:** Incomplete tasks create mental tension
**Implementation:**

- Create natural completion points

**Specific Features:**
- **Progress Indicators**: "2 of 3 suburbs compared"
- **Incomplete Reminders**: "You started comparing these suburbs..."
- **Completion Prompts**: "Finish your comparison to see insights"
- **Task Persistence**: Save state, return to complete

---

### Model 9: **Anchoring & Adjustment** (Tversky & Kahneman)
**Application:** First information influences subsequent judgments
**Implementation:**
- Present high-quality reference points first
- Use strategic score ordering
- Provide context anchors (percentiles, rankings)
- Frame comparisons advantageously

**Specific Features:**
- **Strategic Anchoring**: Show best suburb first, then alternatives
- **Percentile Anchors**: "Top 15% of all Melbourne suburbs"
- **Price Anchors**: "Average for this price range is..."
- **Comparison Anchors**: "Compared to your previous search..."

---

### Model 10: **Hick's Law** (Choice Complexity)
**Application:** More choices = longer decision time
**Implementation:**
- Limit options at each step
- Use progressive filtering
- Provide recommendations to reduce choice
- Group similar options

**Specific Features:**
- **Limited Initial Options**: 10 suburbs in dropdown, not 397

**Specific Features:**
- **Value First**: 3 free searches, detailed scores
- **Unexpected Value**: Bonus insights, comparison features
- **Natural Reciprocity**: "Enjoying this? Upgrade for more"
- **Easy Return**: Simple sign-up, one-click upgrade

---

### Model 14: **Commitment & Consistency** (Cialdini)
**Application:** People act consistently with commitments
**Implementation:**
- Get small commitments (save search, set preferences)
