## Prompt for Icon Generation

Create three app icons for a property evaluation website called "HomeScorePro". All icons should be square format with the following specifications:

### Icon Specifications:

1. **192x192 pixel icon**
   - Square format, 192x192 pixels
   - Used for general app icons

2. **512x512 pixel icon**
   - Square format, 512x512 pixels
   - Used for high-resolution displays

3. **180x180 pixel icon**
   - Square format, 180x180 pixels
   - Used specifically for iOS devices

### Design Requirements:

**Brand Colors:**
- Primary: #000428 (dark navy blue)
- Secondary: #764ba2 (purple)
- Accent: #00AEEF (bright cyan)

**Design Style:**
- Simple and recognizable design that works at small sizes
- Incorporate the brand colors (can use gradient from dark blue to purple)
- High contrast for visibility on various backgrounds
- No text - icon should be purely visual
- Centered composition - important elements should be centered
- Professional and modern appearance

**Suggested Visual Elements:**
- House/home symbol (represents property/real estate)
- Score/rating element (represents evaluation/scoring)
- Can use geometric shapes
- Gradient background using brand colors (dark blue to purple)
- Clean, minimalist design

**Technical Requirements:**
- PNG format with transparent background
- Square canvas (no rounded corners needed - OS will handle that)
- High quality, crisp edges
- All three sizes should be visually consistent (same design, different resolutions)

### Example Concept:
A house icon with a score/evaluation element, using a gradient background from dark blue (#000428) to purple (#764ba2), with a bright cyan (#00AEEF) accent. The design should be simple enough to be recognizable at 192x192 but detailed enough to look professional at 512x512.

**Generate three PNG images: one at 192x192, one at 512x512, and one at 180x180 pixels, all with the same design but optimized for their respective sizes.**
